# Building Motion Detection Alarm System with Raspberry Pi
The objective of this project is to detect if is there is an intruder or not, if  motion is sensed raise an alarm. The system can be set to armed and unarmed  state. 

For the Alarm system two libraries are needed, which are:
. LCD1602 (Library for 12C connection of the LCD1602 to the raspberry pi). the file is safe as LCD1602.py.
. KPLIB (Library for reading a 16 button keypad on the raspberry pi). the fie is safe as KPLIB.py.


# Components
# Keypads
    Keypad Setup
    . The keypad has eight leads which represents row and colums.
      The first four leads are: Row 0,1,2,3 and the remaining four leads are: Column 0,1,2,3.
    
    # How to hook up keypad pins(lead) to Raspberry pi:
    . Starting from row 0 i.e the leftmost pin from the keypad pin to pin 11, 13, 15, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37.

# LCD
    LCD Setup
    . Turning LCD upside down, the let pin is the ground(GND). Ground goes to   ground on rspberry pi, pin 14 can be used on the raspberry pi.
    . The next pin on the LCD is VCC which is 5 volts , pin 4 or pin 2 can be used on the raspberry pi.

# PIR sensor
    PIR Setup
    . Turning the sensor upside down the leftmost is the VCC which needs to go to 5 volts pin on the raspberry pi. Pin 2 or 4 can be used.
    . The centre pin is the signal pin, that will be pinned to the first convenient GPIO pin. pin 12 on the raspberry pi can be used.
    . The right most is the ground(GND), goes to ground(GND) on rapberry pi.
